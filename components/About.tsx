        A long time ago, far far away in a land called JÃ¤mtland, I began my
        journey as a technical support novis and worked my way up until I felt
        that my technical skills had to (needed to) grow. So I studied hard to
        land a spot at the 2-year long program for{" "}

          Front End Development at Medieinstitutet
        </span>{" "}
        and I totally fell stumbling down a rocky road of what the jeebz. But
        here we are, transitioning into a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Full Stack Developer</span> with a focus
        on{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js and TypeScript. I come with extensive experience in the
          e-commerce business. Loaded with creative ideas and, that I found out,
          a great skill in bug fixing. Which I have heard is basically all you
          need so...{" "}
        </span>
        Currently on the hunt for someone to adopt me, foster me and give me a
        place to grow all my new super-powers and gain a developer that always
        have a &quot;how can I help&quot; attitude.

      <p>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>

      <p>I would love to get a job</p>

      <p>
        I bring extensive experience in e-commerce, paired with a creative
        mindset and, as I&#39;ve discovered, a knack for bug fixingâ€”which
        I&#39;ve been told is basically all you need.
      </p>

      <p>Please hire me!</p>
    </motion.section>
